- Sku Era Addon Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku Era r32.28
	- Fixed a bug with the route calculation that was sometimes generating incorrect routes leading into walls, etc.
	- Fixed another bug with the auction house categories for full scan results by item and removed overlooked debug outputs.
	- Added a new feature: Sku focus units
		This is adding 8 extra focus units. Basically they are working like the usual focus slash command, but they are using unit names instead of specific units. 
		This means, they won't always target a specific unit like the standard /focus command. They will target the next available mob with a specific name (!) or part of a name.
		Imagine that like you doing /tar with a name. It's exactly the same. If there is only one npc, mob or player with that name around, then it will target that one. If there are multiple units with the name (or part of then name), then it will target a random unit of those.
		There are 8 new Sku key binds to set focus 1 to 8 to your current target. ("Set focus x to the name of your current target")
		There are 8 new Sku key binds to target focus 1 to 8. ("Target focus x")
		There is a new slash command to set focus 1 to 8 to your current target: /focusX (/focus1, /focus2, and so on. Attention for screenreader users: /focus1 is one command. There's space before the number.) 
		And there is a slash command to target focus 1 to 8: /click focusX (/click focus1, /click focus2, and so on. Again, focus1 without a space before the number! So, /click space focus1.)
		The /focusX command provides some enhanced options. Using it without any additions will set the focus x to your targets name.
		Using it with any addition will set the focusx to that name. Example: /focus1 william. This will target every unit with a name starting with "William".
		And you can use it with fixed game unit ids. Like party1, party2, pet, player, raid1 to raidx, boss1 to bossx, and so on. With a unit id added it will use the name of that unit (if the unit exists). Example: /focus1 party1 will target the name of party member one.

	- Fixed the talent menu. Should work now.
	- The Turn to beacon hot key (default: I) is not longer fixed and can be set to any key. Starting the wow menu script isn't required anymore to use that feature.
	- Added the Turn to Unit feature from Wrath
		This is auto turning you to units like your target, party members, mobs with game markers like Skull, or mobs with sku markers like Blue.
		The feature is not 100% accurate. Sometimes it is turning you straight to the unit. Sometimes it ends up left or right of the unit. It gets less accurate the closer the unit is. It gets less accurate the faster the speed setting is (see below). It depends on your machines speed/your fps. Faster is more accurate. Low fps can lead to completely inaccurate results.
		It works reliably with units up to 41 meters away. If the unit is more than 41 meters away, the success rate will be quite worse. It works everywhere. Open world, dungeons, even battlegrounds. It works for all unit types. However, the unit must by on your physical level. Units above or below you, or units behind walls etc. wonâ€™t work.
		There are 6 new keybindings to use this feature: Sku key binds > Turn to unit 1-6. They are are bound to no key by default. Each keybind is turning you to a different unit (see below). 1 is your target, 2 is skull, 3 is cross, 4 is square, and 5 & 6 are nothing
		There are settings under Core > Options > Turn to target:
		- Unit selection: This is where you set the units for the 6 key bindings. The default units for key 1-6 are: target, skull, cross, square, nothing, nothing
		- Speed: the faster, the less accurate
		- Enhanced settings: do not touch unless prompted

Changes in Sku Era r32.23

	- Added rune skills/spells to the F11 action bar config menu: Core > Action Bars > Action bar > Action button x > Runes. That menu has only spells if you are wearing engraved items that do provide spells/abilities.
